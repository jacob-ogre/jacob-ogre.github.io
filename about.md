Hello! Did you end up here by accident? If not, have a look around...if so, then still feel free to look around.

### About me

I'm a biologist by nature and training. I did my Bachelor's in Conservation biology at [Prescott College](http://www.prescott.edu) and my Ph.D. in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at [The University of Texas at Austin](http://utexas.edu). By early morning, day, and most evenings, I'm the Endangered Species Science and Policy Analyst at [Defenders of Wildlife](http://www.defenders.org). (Of course, nothing I write here should be taken to represent the positions or opinions of Defenders of Wildlife.) Coding is a significant component of that work - see also our GitHub org, [Defenders-ESC](https://www.github.com/Defenders-ESC).

On weekends and some evenings I get to be out-and-about doing biology. The observations arising out of that time out-and-about can be found at [iNaturalist](http://www.inaturalist.com/observations/jacobogre). And there are bird checklists at [E-bird](http://ebird.org/) under user `jwmalcom`.
