title: A quick review of recent papers, 2017-02-19

# Introduction

I subscribe to RSS feeds for dozens of journals and (usually) review those feeds
every morning and every evening. There is usually at least one paper each day
that I share with colleagues via email. But I miss people who might find a paper
interesting, and mass emails to \#STAFF would be annoying. Plus, there might be
people out "there," somewhere, who aren't coworkers but who might find these
discoveries interesting. Instead of bombarding people who may never find those 
papers of interest with emails they do not want, and to make my time reviewing
more worthwhile, I will try out the GitHub Pages blog for sharing on a regular
basis. Each post will contain records for each paper I find of interest, including:

- the title of the paper of interest; 
- link(s) to the paper, including the journal page and, as needed and avaialable,
a link to the full text;
- a short summary of the paper;
- a brief comment about why I flagged the paper, e.g., potential for future work.

Most of the time, I will have _not_ read the full paper before posting, so 
please excuse any errors or misunderstandings.

In this initial post I will just highlight two papers as a test...

## Retrospective Analysis of Heavy Metal Contamination in Rhode Island Based on Old and New Herbarium Specimens

__URL__ http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.3732/apps.1600108 (OA)

__Summary__ The authors compare the concentrations of lead, copper, and zinc in
historical herbarium specimens (1846 - 1916) to levels in contemporary specimens.
The area they sampled in Rhode Island is of interest because some of the sites
were the focus of heavy industrialization, and some of those were subject to 
more recent remediation.

__Comment__ I think a project using this approach at a multi-watershed scale
could be really interesting for building a map of contaminant changes. For 
example, many Endangered Species Act-listed species, such as fishes and mussels,
face contamination threats. Although direct comparisons with, e.g., 
[EPA's water quality assessments](https://iaspub.epa.gov/waters10/attains_index.home)
are probably a stretch, historical data from herbarium specimens might add 
useful context for understanding how conditions have changed over a longer
time-frame.

## 3D-printed eagle eye: Compound microlens system for foveated imaging

__URL__ http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/2/e1602655?rss=1 (OA)

__Summary__ The authors report printing tiny - ca. 100 micron diameter - lenses
of various focal lengths. When placed on an imaging sensor, these microlenses
capture compound images that can be combined to create [foveated](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/2/e1602655?rss=1) 
images.

__Comment__ Next, insect-sized drones that can image an area without getting
in the way or being conspicuous. Could take monitoring to a new level. That is
a ways off, but this strikes me as really cool.
